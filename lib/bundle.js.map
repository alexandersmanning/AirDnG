As a local, I instantly realized that a number of the identifiers I would use to describe a neighborhood, whether it is known for a specific type of food, culture, or even recent historical events, were all but missing from the majority of ads.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEven then, one can still gain reasonable insight into neighborhoods, and their culture. North Beach for example uses words like community, creating, together, and vibe, while Mission and Haigh Ashbury will use the word modern, new, and bars to describe their younger demographic. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"about-text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the near future, I hope to analyze additional major cities to see if this trend continues, or if it has more to do with the listings in San Francisco, as opposed to New York or Chicago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</content>\n\t\t\t\t\t</Modal>\n\t\t\t\t</section> )\n\n\t\t// /\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe idea for the site came about from years of attending concerts, and hoping for a way of finding last minute small shows.
